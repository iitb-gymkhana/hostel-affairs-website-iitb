      You must carry your ID card at all times and produce them on demand from security. This particularly holds good
      if you are trying to come back into IIT campus from outside. There is a penalty of Rs 200 for not having the ID
      card with you and this penalty might be increased if you misbehave with the security personnel.
    </li>

      No riding of manual/motorized two/four wheeler in the corridors of the academic area.

      Stay away from the lakeside area after dark and do not attempt to climb the hill as well. This is for your own

    Over the past year, quite a few laptops/mobiles have been stolen/lost/misplaced. Students need to be especially
    vigilant and careful. Such incidences have happened at all times of day and night.

  <ol>
    <li>
      <span class="has-text-weight-bold">NEVER GO OUT LEAVING YOUR ROOM UNLOCKED</span>. If you have a room-mate who is
      in the habit of doing so, impress upon
      him or her that this is an inconvenience you cannot afford.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="has-text-weight-bold">WHEN YOU GO TO SLEEP LATCH YOUR ROOM</span>. Recently a laptop was stolen when
      a student was sleeping in the room. Set
      up a schedule with your roommate so that he or she does not have to wake you up at ungodly hours.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="has-text-weight-bold">IF SOMETHING IS LOST / STOLEN / MISPLACED REPORT FIRST TO SECURITY</span>.
      They will help you file a proper police
      complaint if required. There are certain categories of complaints, under which, even if you find your lost
      property, you have to deposit it with the police (else they seize the material), until the issue is resolved in
      court. Take the advice of security officers regarding this.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="has-text-weight-bold">IF YOU LOSE YOUR INSTITUTE ID-Card</span>, do not directly complain to the
      police. Complain to the security section.
      They will compile all such complaints over a period, and report to the police. Meanwhile, they will issue a
      Duplicate ID card after due process, fines, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="has-text-weight-bold">IF YOU HAD ALREADY REPORTED ABOUT LOST ID-Card AND GOT A DUPLICATE ISSUED, BUT
        FOUND YOUR ORIGINAL ID-Card</span> after
      a while, please deposit the duplicate to the security section as soon as possible. If you are found with two ID
      cards,, you are liable to face the Disciplinary Action Committee and face a minimum punishment of semester
      suspension.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="has-text-weight-bold">HOSTEL ENTRY POLICY</span>: Male/female students may enter and retain
